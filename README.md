# Deep Learning for Lithium Response Prediction in Bipolar Disorder

This project outlines a proposed hybrid study to develop and validate a deep learning pharmacogenomics (PGx) model that predicts lithium response in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD). The methodology integrates genomic, transcriptomic, methylation, and clinical data, using both retrospective datasets and a newly recruited prospective cohort.

## Project Highlights

- Combines data from **ConLiGen**, **PGBD**, and 100 new BD patients
- Multi-omic inputs: SNPs, RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and clinical scales
- Late-fusion neural network with interpretable outputs via **SHAP**
- Emphasis on **ethics**, **bias mitigation**, and **Canadian-aligned data governance**

## Included Files

- `methodology/rewritten_methodology_by_anushka.md`: Full study design (937 words)
- `figures/Study_Visuals.pdf`: Contains Figure 1 (Timeline Schematic) and Table 1 (Methodology Summary)

## Future Directions

- Code implementation of the model (Python/PyTorch)
- Synthetic data mockup for public demonstration
- External validation using held-out retrospective subsets

## Ethics & Governance

- Designed for Canadian REB approval under **TCPS 2**
- PIPEDA-aligned privacy protocols
- Equity-focused recruitment and fairness-aware modeling
