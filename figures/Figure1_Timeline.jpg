Figure 1. Overview of the project timeline and workflow across seven sequential steps. Step 01 corresponds to the retrospective phase: aggregation and preprocessing of existing datasets from ConLiGen and PGBD (see Sections 2.1-2.2). Steps 02-07 comprise the prospective phase. Step 02 initiates prospective recruitment of 100 lithium-na√Øve patients with bipolar disorder (BD) (Section 2.2). Step 03 involves multi-omics and clinical data collection (Section 2.3). Steps 04-06 describe model development: training a multilayer feed-forward neural network (MFNN) using prospective data (Step 04; Section 2.6), validation with a dedicated internal subset (Step 05; Sections 2.6-2.7), and final testing on a held-out dataset (Step 06; Section 2.7). Step 07 captures longitudinal follow-up at 6-month intervals for up to 36 months, supporting outcome refinement and model updating (Section 2.8). Collectively, these steps follow the two-phase structure detailed in Section 2.1: retrospective pre-training followed by prospective fine-tuning and validation.
